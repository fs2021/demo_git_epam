I'm ever so lost
I can't find my way
Been searchin', but I have never seen
A turnin', a turnin' from deceit
'Cause a child, roses light
Tried to reveal, what I could feel
I can't understand myself
Anymore
'Cause, I'm still feelin' lonely
Feelin' so unholy
'Cause a child, roses light
Tried to reveal, what I could feel
I'm lonely
It just won't leave me alone
Oh, no
I'm foolin' somebody
A faithless path, I roam
Deceiving, to breathe this secretly
The silence, the silence, I can't bear
'Cause a child roses light
Tries to reveal, what I could feel
And this loneliness
It just won't leave me alone
Oh, no
And this loneliness
It just won't leave me alone
A lady of war
A lady of war
